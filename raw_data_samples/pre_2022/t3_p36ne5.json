I got her out of few abusive relationships (one of her exes ended up in the jail how abusive he was) but I am getting tired of it. \\n\\nShe is an amazing friend, helped me out too. But she has a phobia of being alone and always picks wrong men just so she is not alone. So I help her and guide her as much as I can. I spend hours and hours every day on the phone with her. Got her into therapy but that didn\\u2019t help. The problem is she is \\u2018missing me too much\\u2019, wants me \\u2018to move back\\u2019, or that \\u2018she moves in with me\\u2019. With sexy voice. Sends me flirty messages when gets drunk. I live with my boyfriend. She had few inappropriate comments before but it came to the point of her sending me voice messages of love poems with sexual voice. She is not lesbian or bi, that I know of. Actually a girl flirted with her few months ago and she said no (I know from other friends, not just her side of the story). When she gets into sexy voice of missing me or those inappropriate comments before I always made light of it or brushed it off and try to change the subject because it\\u2019s making me so uncomfortable. But here I am with 3 sexy voice, love poem, voice messages and I don\\u2019t know how to respond. \\n\\nIf she wasn\\u2019t such a nice friend to me I would drop her LONG time ago how bad her life is (that she never managed to fix and always makes the same mistakes over and over again) and I am the only one who knows everything she went though. If I don\\u2019t answer her phone call, she makes a drama. When she doesn\\u2019t answer phone for 3 days, it\\u2019s nothing. \\n\\nI am scared to cut her off completely because she is not stable without me (she works and has a social life) but I am getting tired of babysitting + receiving these kind of messages. I\\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 7 years, I am happy. I want her in my life but I am just not comfortable with this and I am tired of dropping hints that she doesn\\u2019t get. She knows I am straight, she knows details about my sex life so I am being put in an uncomfortable spot. Then she goes on a date and tells me her details until the time comes again for the sexy voice.

You are perfectly within your rights to do the same with this person if she&amp;#39;s no longer a positive or welcome presence in your life, and you shouldn&amp;#39;t worry about hurting her in the process- if she&amp;#39;s anything like me, she might need to be hurt, and to be left behind by enough people she cares about to make it really sink in that her behavior is abnormal and she needs an actual therapist. In any case it doesn&amp;#39;t sound like this relationship is benefitting you at all anymore, and it really doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be good for her either. An actual break might be what you need, if there is anything left here to salvage.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;\",\n                                    \"can_gild\": true,\n                                    \"can_mod_post\": false,\n                                    \"collapsed\": false,\n                                    \"collapsed_because_crowd_control\": null,\n                                    \"collapsed_reason\": null,\n                                    \"collapsed_reason_code\": null,\n                                    \"comment_type\": null,\n                                    \"controversiality\": 0,\n                                    \"created\": 1628819549.0,\n                                    \"created_utc\": 1628819549.0,\n                                    \"depth\": 0,\n                                    \"distinguished\": null,\n                                    \"downs\": 0,\n                                    \"edited\": false,\n                                    \"gilded\": 0,\n                                    \"gildings\": {},\n                                    \"id\": \"h8qdlq3\",\n                                    \"is_submitter\": false,\n                                    \"likes\": null,\n                                    \"link_id\": \"t3_p36ne5\",\n                                    \"locked\": false,\n                                    \"mod_note\": null,\n                                    \"mod_reason_by\": null,\n                                    \"mod_reason_title\": null,\n                                    \"mod_reports\": [],\n                                    \"name\": \"t1_h8qdlq3\",\n                                    \"no_follow\": false,\n                                    \"num_reports\": null,\n                                    \"parent_id\": \"t3_p36ne5\",\n                                    \"permalink\": \"/r/relationships/comments/p36ne5/how_to_explain_to_my_straight_friend_that_i_am/h8qdlq3/\",\n                                    \"removal_reason\": null,\n                                    \"replies\": \"\",\n                                    \"report_reasons\": null,\n                                    \"saved\": false,\n                                    \"score\": 6,\n                                    \"score_hidden\": false,\n                                    \"send_replies\": true,\n                                    \"stickied\": false,\n                                    \"subreddit\": \"relationships\",\n                                    \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qjvn\",\n                                    \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/relationships\",\n                                    \"subreddit_type\": \"public\",\n                                    \"top_awarded_type\": null,\n                                    \"total_awards_received\": 0,\n                                    \"treatment_tags\": [],\n                                    \"unrepliable_reason\": null,\n                                    \"ups\": 6,\n                                    \"user_reports\": []\n                              },\n                              \"kind\": \"t1\"\n                        },\n                        {\n                              \"data\": {\n                                    \"all_awardings\": [],\n                                    \"approved_at_utc\": null,\n                                    \"approved_by\": null,\n                                    \"archived\": true,\n                                    \"associated_award\": null,\n                                    \"author\": \"kamikasei\",\n                                    \"author_flair_background_color\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_richtext\": [],\n                                    \"author_flair_template_id\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_text\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_text_color\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_type\": \"text\",\n                                    \"author_fullname\": \"t2_1ue1\",\n                                    \"author_is_blocked\": false,\n                                    \"author_patreon_flair\": false,\n                                    \"author_premium\": true,\n                                    \"awarders\": [],\n                                    \"banned_at_utc\": null,\n                                    \"banned_by\": null,\n                                    \"body\": \"Figure out what your boundaries are.

It wouldn\\u2019t be ok if I wasn\\u2019t straight. Thanks for opening my eyes, that\\u2019s why I asked here, when you are in a situation for too long you can\\u2019t see everything clearly. About being a free therapist, well I tried. And somehow manages to always go back with bad guys and problems and \\u2018I need you\\u2019 messages and I feel guilty of her being alone and we go around in circles. And then everyone around me is saying how nice she is, why are you so harsh, well they don\\u2019t spend hours daily talking to her so I am sick of it. Your comment made me feel better, thank you&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;\",\n                                                                  \"can_gild\": true,\n
