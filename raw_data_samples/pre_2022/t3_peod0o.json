dating and it sort of weirds me out, I don't know whether to call her out on it. It makes me quite uncomfortable because I know she's lying or exaggerating and the way she does it seems, i don't know....jus odd.\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\nSo my female friend, perhaps one of my best friends is the friend of my ex-gf. That's how we got close actually, she and my ex would sometimes get into arguments and they'd talk to each other through me (weird I know).\\n\\nAnyway, that relationship ended but I and Beth (my female friend) remained friends. We've been close for 5 years now.\\n\\nI love having her as a friend as she gives sometimes good advice on my dating life, she's also really smart and likewise, I help her out with my dating life. She's funny and good company.\\n\\nHowever, there is a marked difference in the last 3 years or so with how she discusses her dating life with me.\\n\\nMaybe I'm too open, but literally, almost every date I give her details, she also askes a lot of questions especially sexual questions. She loves finding out what I did in bed with them. Which I know it's kinda cool, kinda weird but I give her some details.\\n\\nHowever, with her, I notice she goes months without telling me about a guy she's seeing or screwing on the side.\\n\\nAnd when she does, it's almost like a girl describing prince charming, she goes on about his looks, his sexual prowess etc. Which i let her talk, I do feel weirded out sometimes by how highly she talks about them because it seems almost unrealistically fake.\\n\\nThen the inevitable happens, usually, a month after they start dating I get the real version, how he's an asshole, controlling, sexist, small penis, erectile dysfunction, cheating, smells etc.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis literally has happened 6 times in 3 years and it's just weird. I also find it weird that in every single case the guy dumps her.\\n\\nI don't try to pry into her private life, and in all honesty, I don't care.\\n\\nBUT, last night she did the 'fairy tale' thing again which seems so weird. I wish I could copy and paste her messages here and you'd see how weird.\\n\\nAlso, I think it's a bit weird to keep blabbing like this to your platonic guy friend, it's almost as if she's trying to make me jealous or something.\\n\\nI looked back at the messages I sent to her about girls I'm dating or seeing and they're so much more honest. For example (and this is me being crude so forgive me).\\n\\nI'd send things like, \\\"Well date went fine, she's funny, cleavage was distracting me all night, made out with her in carpark a bit, but didn't really enjoy it......still went back to her apartment to bang, haha\\\" or \\\"I took her to pier cuz u know, girls like romantic shit like that.....however, damn it actually was pretty romantic for me too....or maybe it was the weed we smoked\\\". I always try to add some humour to it and that's as far as I'd voluntarily tell her. However, her messages would be like:\\n\\n*\\\"He is so amazing, so handsome and tall, he had me naked in a heart beat and ate my ass out for what felt like forever, i had 7 amazing mind blowing orgasms, he knows how to work my body soooo good\\\"*\\n\\nNot sure if you can tell the difference in the messages. I always respond to her telling her TMI.\\n\\nMy main issue here is why does she do this? For days we'd be chatting normally, talking about serious stuff, world issues, movies, music, etc and then bam she 'opens up' and tells me about this.\\n\\nNow that's 100% fine, and this could be the one chance is actually true, but almost always it turns out to be lies or big exaggerations.\\n\\nHelp me understand her.\\n\\nMy gut tells me she's trying to make me jealous, but even then that doesn't make sense because why not tell me from before.\\n\\nI could have made her jealous the day before as I told her I'm taking this girl I've been seeing for 5 months for a weekend vacation down at the Keys for her birthday next week.\\n\\nBut i mean she knows I'm seeing her, she askes about her a lot and i do tell her things are going well. I mean I can see a weekend trip might make her act up. So I guess it's a possiblity.\\n\\nMy guy friends tell me that because I'm not chasing after her like many other men, that already makes her want me a bit, and they're sure, she considers me an option and is just waiting.\\n\\nWhile that COULD also be true, we've been alone together many times and she has not done anyting to seduce me.\\n\\nI've been in situations with other female friends where when we're alone, they'd do lots of things to seduce me, but she hasn't.\\n\\nBefore anyone asks, I have no interest in her romantically, while she is very attractive and we get along great, I know it won't work out as we're too different. Also, I like a very different type of woman, she's a bit too introverted and conservative for my tastes.\\n\\n**tldr;**\\n\\nMy (31M) platonic female friend (30F) acts weird and lies about guys she's dating and it sort of weirds me out, I don't know whether to call her out on it.

It makes me quite uncomfortable because I know she&amp;#39;s lying or exaggerating and the way she does it seems, i don&amp;#39;t know....jus odd.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n                                    \"send_replies\": true,\n                                    \"spoiler\": false,\n                                    \"stickied\": false,\n                                    \"subreddit\": \"relationships\",\n                                    \"subreddit_id\": \"t5_2qjvn\",\n                                    \"subreddit_name_prefixed\": \"r/relationships\",\n                                    \"subreddit_subscribers\": 3237955,\n                                    \"subreddit_type\": \"public\",\n                                    \"suggested_sort\": \"confidence\",\n                                    \"thumbnail\": \"\",\n                                    \"title\": \"My (31M) platonic female friend (30F) acts weird and lies about guys she's dating and it sort of weirds me out, I don't know whether to call her out on it.\",\n                                    \"top_awarded_type\": null,\n                                    \"total_awards_received\": 0,\n                                    \"treatment_tags\": [],\n                                    \"ups\": 0,\n                                    \"upvote_ratio\": 0.33,\n                                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/peod0o/my_31m_platonic_female_friend_30f_acts_weird_and/\",\n                                    \"user_reports\": [],\n                                    \"view_count\": null,\n                                    \"visited\": false,\n                                    \"whitelist_status\": \"all_ads\",\n                                    \"wls\": 6\n                              },\n                              \"kind\": \"t3\"\n                        }\n                  ],\n                  \"dist\": 1,\n                  \"geo_filter\": \"\",\n                  \"modhash\": null\n            },\n            \"kind\": \"Listing\"\n      },\n      {\n            \"data\": {\n                  \"after\": null,\n                  \"before\": null,\n                  \"children\": [\n                        {\n                              \"data\": {\n                                    \"all_awardings\": [],\n                                    \"approved_at_utc\": null,\n                                    \"approved_by\": null,\n                                    \"archived\": true,\n                                    \"associated_award\": null,\n                                    \"author\": \"MLeek\",\n                                    \"author_flair_background_color\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_css_class\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_richtext\": [],\n                                    \"author_flair_template_id\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_text\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_text_color\": null,\n                                    \"author_flair_type\": \"text\",\n                                    \"author_fullname\": \"t2_10d53s\",\n                                    \"author_is_blocked\": false,\n                                    \"author_patreon_flair\": false,\n                                    \"author_premium\": false,\n                                    \"awarders\": [],\n                                    \"banned_at_utc\": null,\n                                    \"banned_by\": null,\n                                    \"body\": \"Dude, those two messages aren't *that* far apart.
