{"So my gf (F 23) and I (M 22) have dated for 8 months now. It\u2019s my first relationship and we love each other so much. However, my gf\u2019s last relationship a couple years ago was extremely abusive and toxic. She hasn\u2019t gotten therapy for it yet, and because of it, she has toxic tendencies that are completely unintentional. She also has depression and anxiety causing her to have intense reactions when emotional. \n\nShe has the tendency to take her emotions out on me when she\u2019s upset about something external and be rude to me. She gaslights me during arguments and raises her voice at me and is aggressive while I\u2019m trying to be civil. And she always becomes rational and apologizes after the fact.\n\nI recently called her out on it when the gaslighting was quite clear. And she listened and acknowledged it and has been emotional the past 2 days about it. She feels terrible about herself. She said she would take therapy and I don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this. I thought it was all well, but we called today, and she was really emotional saying she was insecure I\u2019d leave her. And that she doesn\u2019t think I love her anymore after calling her out on her gaslighting and emotional abuse. I reassured her for like 45 minutes saying I still loved her and wanted to work with her and that I forgave her, but it didn\u2019t help. She is upset at herself, all over the place, and just doesn\u2019t seem ready to have a solution-oriented discussion. She did tell me throughout that my reassurance wasn\u2019t helping her and I could leave. But it was my fault for staying on the call and continuing to try to make her feel better.\n\nI\u2019m just so fatigued and had to do all this after a whole day of work. I really love her and want to stay because she could change. She has been so good to me otherwise and we have so much fun together. I don\u2019t know what to do. I feel so helpless. Any advice?\n\nTLDR: Called gf out on gaslighting and emotional abuse, and she acknowledged it and said she was really sorry. But now she\u2019s been having an emotional breakdown and thinks I don\u2019t love her anymore. I\u2019m exhausted. What do I do?": [99999], "Her making you reassure her that you still love her and won't leave her after she abused you is also abuse and unacceptable. Stop doing that, because it just reinforces her abusive behavior. Instead you can say, \"It's normal to feel terrible when you do a terrible thing, but the thing to do is to stop doing terrible things.\" or \"Well, hopefully therapy will make things work out.\" or even, \"I do not currently intend to leave you, but if you keep abusing me, then that will probably change.\" Harsh, but fair. And it doesn't cause you to keep encouraging the abuse. \n\nIf she can't stop abusing you, then she does need to be single. It doesn't matter why she is abusing you. It's not okay to use a person as your training device to heal from trauma. She needs to become somebody who doesn't abuse others. And if she is truly a good person, she will demonstrate that by making getting therapy a priority she acts on and puts real work into.": [40], "You're girlfriend is abusive.  Regardless of it is a trauma response or not, she is abusing you and you shouldn't be okay with it just because of her last relationship.  Honestly these aren't learned behaviors in that since her last relationship was probably toxic on both ends not just his.  These things are only going to get worse.\n\nWithout some sort of intervention it's not going to get better.  Most states have free domestic violance classes.  She should go to them.  She should also seek therapy.  This is not healthy for you and can end very bably.": [36], "Stop being her therapist. You\u2019re her therapist right now. Stop it.": [31], "Oh, no.\n\nThat wasn't an emotional breakdown.  that was more emotional abuse and manipulation.   while you are the one 'wronged' you're reassuring HER.  \n\nnope.": [28], " Even if you've already tried talking it out,calling out when it happens, etc. If the wheels haven't started to turn for some sort of therapy and or a way to help them sort through all that pain/trauma then it won't get better. It'll feel like you're a phone that'll never be fully charged. Or a dog on a leash could be another term. \n\nEven if you love them it's still a good idea to make sure your needs are met as well. You can only do so much before you realize what you got yourself into and hope to find a way out. \nIt sounds like you've been fairly reasonable with them and have tried to be as supportive as you can. \nIf they aren't able to move past that pain/trauma in a decent way then things most likely won't get any or much better. (had a fairly abusive ex myself, it's not a good time)": [25], "What happens when you just let her be upset?": [13], "She needs to not dump this on you. What she's doing, getting you to comfort her and soothe her over her own abusive behavior, is incredibly toxic and unsustainable. She needs a therapist, and if she can't commit to that, follow through quickly, and refrain from doing this toxic shit to you then maybe this relationship wasn't meant to be, since she's not in a healthy enough place to treat you acceptably.": [11], "\u201cI need to be able to tell you when I\u2019m upset about something without it being turned back on me so that I have to comfort you.  So from now on I will tell you, give you a chance to apologize and then go or get off the phone.  \n\nBut please start taking care of this issue. \u201c\n\nLet her have her breakdown and cry it out.  She needs to do that without an audience.": [9], "So you're upset and she managed to make it about her again and has you making her feel better?\n\nSounds like she's still manipulating.": [7], "Remind her that the goal is not to get her to stop attacking you. The goal is to get her to deal with her emotions in a healthy way. Just because she stopped using anger to release them and left you alone does not mean she is doing the right thing. Turning from anger and targeting you simply to use pity and guilt to target herself is no better. You want to help her find actual healthy and good ways to release her emotions. You are in it for the long haul and she does not deserve her own self abuse any.ore than you ever deserved it.": [6], "To the curb she goes if she doesn\u2019t change.": [5], "&gt;  She hasn\u2019t gotten therapy for it yet, and because of it, she has toxic tendencies that are completely unintentional. She also has depression and anxiety causing her to have intense reactions when emotional. \n\nAnd yet, she is still responsible for all her reactions. \n\n&gt; She said she would take therapy and I don\u2019t deserve to be treated like this.\n\nAnd has she taken steps to get help? Saying that you feel terrible but don't do nothing to actually get help, means nothing, because these problems are just going to keep repeating. \n\nAnd in fact:\n\n&gt; that she doesn\u2019t think I love her anymore after calling her out on her gaslighting and emotional abuse. I reassured her for like 45 minutes saying I still loved her and wanted to work with her and that I forgave her, but it didn\u2019t help.\n\nThis is what they call emotional manipulation, whether she does it intentionally or not: you feel terrible that she feels terrible, so that you'll hopefully drop the \"going to therapy\" bit.\n\nI'll ask you one question: if she doesn't take therapy and you two keep entering these continuous loops of her lashing out at you, you and her feeling bad, her apologizing, telling you that you deserve better and promising to get help , not actually getting help, rinse and repeat: how long can you keep going?\n\nI had a sibling relationships exactly like this: anxiety issues, emotional outbursts and lashing out, walking forever on eggshells, apologies afterwards: the entire lot. For every outburst of theirs, I actually fought back hard because I knew that I didn't deserve to be treated like this. \n\nEven then, the apologies became meaningless because we were restarting the same spiel over and over again. Resentment started to build hard: it weren't even the outbursts that were the main cause, it was the fact that every day the bomb could burst and that my life was essentially revolving around their emotional state.\n\nIf there is a thing where you have to call out an ultimatum, this is going to be it. You can't keep going like this and this life isn't fair on you.": [4], "Wow, this describes my situation right now...exactly. \nI wanted us to go to therapy so she can deal with her anger issues and for me on how I can better help her...but she refuses to go because she doesn't believe she needs help .\n\nSo now she is leaving me and I  will let her go.": [3], "It sounds like she is still manipulating you. Next time you may think twice about calling her out because you don\u2019t want to send her on a \u201cspiral.\u201d Your girlfriend is pretty toxic.": [2], "If you\u2019ve made it clear to her that her behavior is hurtful to you and she\u2019s not making moves to change that hurtful behavior she doesn\u2019t care. I know it\u2019s hard to hear": [1], "Make an appointment for couples therapy. Don\u2019t confront her about it, but tell her you booked it and are really looking forward to going. She may be hesitant of therapy because of the stigmas attached to it and hasn\u2019t made one because of that.": [0]}
