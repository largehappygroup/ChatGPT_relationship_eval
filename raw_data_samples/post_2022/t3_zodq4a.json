{"So this is my first time posting on Reddit and I'm on phone so I'm sorry if this ends up a block of text.\n\nI'm (32F) am 37 weeks pregnant with our 3rd child. My (31M) partner has never been one for going out or anything like that. We are both home people and would rather chill out at home or locally with a few friends.\n\nHe has been asked out for drinks at work various times by his work friends, which I have no problem about honestly. But this new woman has started at his job and she is not shy about sleeping or hitting on married men, she has even told me stories and it has made me uncomfortable.\n\nNow he has been asked again this year by everyone and he said no but since this new girl started, he only talks about her, has admitted to being attracted to her and is now going drinking with her when she asked. He is blowing off our anniversary plans for this girl and I have let him know how hurt I am about this. He said it is just drinks and we can do something else the next day but I could give birth at any moment so I don't want to go out right now.\n\nAm I being paranoid and need to get over it or am I right to feel upset and uncomfortable? She is younger than us and absolutely stunning, but her being so open about her exploits with married men has me feeling worried, especially when my partner won't even kiss me since she started working there. It feels more like friends sharing a house but with kids.\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: my partner only talks about this new girl and is now going out drinking with her on our anniversary. She openly talks about sleeping with married men and he doesn't see a problem about leaving his heavily pregnant wife to go drinking.": [99999], "ummm Hell no this is not okay!!!  You are pregnant with your 3rd child and he told you he was attracted to her ?? WTF  he has lost his mind!! Omg it is so wrong!!": [101], "...\n\nI mean, my partner and I don't celebrate anniversaries, but--if we did--it would certainly be more important than drinks with a co-worker (especially one the person found attractive, while their partner was carrying their child). It's so totally unreasonable... and that's before you bring in the lack of sexual activity, and her desire to pork monogamously partnered men. You are absolutely not being paranoid or unreasonably upset.": [52], "I was fine with it until he was blowing off your anniversary for \u201cdrinks\u201d with his workmate.": [48], "I swear sometimes it's like clockwork, get pregnant and hubby's eyes start wondering.\n\nStart working on your exit plan, because there is not a square inch on this *planet* where this would be acceptable.": [46], "Your husband is a gigantic a$$hole. This is not okay and I feel bad for you. I\u2019d be giving him a serious cold shoulder for foreseeable future and see if he notices. If not you have your answer": [29], "Uhm please have some self-respect, the signs are there. Are you just going to let him have an affair? I know every girl wants to be okay with their man having friends of the opposite sex, but this is pretty blatant.": [22], "Lol man this dude is stupid.": [20], "Tell him to be careful child support on 3 children isn't cheap.": [18], "Umm holy shit this isn\u2019t okay AT ALL and needs to stop immediately. He is blowing off your anniversary to go drinking with a woman he is admittedly attracted to and you\u2019re almost due to have a baby. Imagine if one of your friends told you that sentence. \n\nYour partner\u2019s behavior is 100% wrong. He needs to delete her number and any social media connections and only have a professional work relationship with her. (It sounds like he is actively trying to cheat on you.) If he isn\u2019t willing to do that then tell him you\u2019re leaving. And I would honestly tell her, and I know it\u2019s not her responsibility, but I would still tell her to back the fuck off.": [17], "Girl, set your boundaries clearly and in writing. If he doesn't agree to act right, stay quiet and prepare for divorce. \nHe's plotting to cheat already. So you plot to respond d to that cheating.": [11], "Hopefully, you'll sit down with him and talk about his inappropriate behaviors. He has children with you and one on the way and he shouldn't be oogling women at work who purposely go out of their way hitting on married men and she admits it and yet he is still hanging out with her? Wow.  I'd tell him you've noticed a change in his behaviors since the new girl started and it is inappropriate considering he is married to you and has 3 children with you. Sometimes the grass is not greener on the other side and if he doesn't wise up soon he'll learn it the hard way.": [8], "Massive absolutely a NO!": [7], "Sorry to hear this.\nWhat he's doing wouldn't fly in my house.\nHe has some choices to make, and you need to decide whether you want to be with someone who is treating you like this in a really vulnerable moment in your life.": [6], "No this is not ok at all.\n\nHe told you he\u2019s attracted to her and he wants to drink with her really ? \n\nThis wouldn\u2019t fly Im sorry, Petty me would pop up on him while he\u2019s at the bar and introduce myself. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f she will see me big belly and all like yes I\u2019m very pregnant and it\u2019s his.\n\nHe\u2019s basically setting himself up to cheat on you.\n\nYou need to put your foot down and say no, tell him that it\u2019s inappropriate to drink with someone he\u2019s attracted to while married with another baby on the way.\n\nThan to blow off his anniversary with his pregnant wife for this girl he\u2019s attracted to is fucked up and he should know that.\n\nHonestly are you close to his or your parents ? if so you should talk to them cause you\u2019re about to give birth and him pulling shit like this is fucked up.\n\nHe\u2019s stressing you out and being suspicious so close to your due date, you shouldn\u2019t deal with this alone and perhaps they can help you talk sense into him.": [4], "Sounds like your man is willing to drop everything for a woman who makes it clear she's willing to f-uck anyone.\n\n\nI say LET YOUR MAN GO. He doesn't respect you. Doesn't respect the relationship either. \n\nWhen he comes back begging for you, serve him with divorce papers.": [3], "I am sad to say he has found himself a WORK WIFE!!!!  And I find this disgusting.  He is married(Or even Taken by)You as Partners and with another blessed event on the Way------He should be celebrating with you and not some flues y.  He needs to back off of her or they will surely end up in the Cheat Sheet.  It is not looking good with all that you have said and I am wondering if he is kissing THAT over by the water cooler now.  Talk to him or you will end up to be another statistic of raising the kids alone.  Shame on HIM!!!!!  Why can't women like That find a single man????": [2]}
