{"My boyfriend (21) and I (20) have been together almost 3 years. He is a wonderful guy and treats me very well. We hardly ever argue and when we do it is always about the same thing. His best friend. His best friend hates my guts. He calls me the most horrible names imaginable. He says horrible things about me and it\u2019s clear that he doesn\u2019t like me. I thought things would change after we were together for a while, but he won\u2019t give it up. He will invite my bf to go places with him and just have girls show up to make me upset. Or tell my bf to break up with me. Every time my bf is with him something bad happens. I have talked to my bf about this multiple times. Saying how hurtful it is and I\u2019m confused why he hates me so much. All my bf ever says is \u201cwell we\u2019ve just been friends for so long\u201d blah blah blah. Tonight I heard that he told a mutual friend that my bf was never going to marry me because I wasn\u2019t the right one for him. Out of all of the nasty things that he\u2019s said about me, that one hurt the most. He knows nothing about our relationship, and he won\u2019t even take the time to get to know me. His best friend is also a pathological liar, a cheater and he treats my bf horribly. Looking into the future, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna deal with his best friend. What do I do? \n\ntl;dr - my boyfriend\u2019s best friend is a horrible person and he is so mean to me. What do I do??": [99999], "\ud83d\ude33\n\n*His best friend hates my guts. He calls me the most horrible names imaginable. He says horrible things about me and it\u2019s clear that he doesn\u2019t like me.*\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever dated someone who would stay friends with someone who said horrible things about their GF. In fact I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever KNOWN anyone who would find this acceptable. Even when someone in my friend group dated someone we all disliked, none said anything about it TO HIM or IN FRONT OF HIM.": [270], "The problem here isn't the best friend at all. It is your boyfriend. What do you do? You leave his ass.\n\n The best friend doesn't owe you shit, but your boyfriend absolutely owes you the basic respect and loyalty of defending you when someone is attacking you. He is failing at it, and it sounds like he's been failing at that for a long time. Like I cannot believe its been years of this. \n\nGirl, please raise your standards. Find someone who would be disgusted with this abusive horse shit, not someone who just shrugs it off.": [189], "I think your boyfriend's best friend is saving your life right now. Your boyfriend sounds pretty spineless. Would you want that in a life partner? \n\nJust leave. The relationship will never go where you want at this rate and his baggage from his friend is too much.": [91], "Yeah your bf is enabling this behavior and not standing up for you. Do you really want to stay with someone who\u2019s okay with standing back and watching as you suffer this abuse?": [55], "Yeah, the problem is your boyfriend.": [23], "There's a saying, \"We are known by the company we keep.\" I'm sorry, but when your boyfriend is with his bestie he is very likely running his mouth against you and tossing you under the bus so hard it's a wonder you don't have tire tracks down your back.\n\nAnd honestly that's probably one of the reasons the bestie hates you and runs his mouth. Because his friend, your boyfriend, laughs about his mistreatment and keeps hanging out with him, likely providing him with ammunition against you. \n\nDrop your boyfriend. I cannot imagine why you'd think you have any future with this boyfriend at all. Like how is that supposed to play out at your wedding. And what do you do when your then husband allows the best friend to trash talk and verbally abuse any kids you two might be unfortunate enough to have? \n\nAnd yeah, if you stay with the BF this is the future you have. Even if he gets rid of the friend tomorrow the fact is he thrives on drama and thrills to having someone around to trash talk about you. He'll find someone else. Your boyfriend is a loser and people are pitying you being with him.": [17], "Your bf is showing he doesn't respect you, your relationship, or your feelings.": [15], "Your boyfriend is garbage.\n\nHe shouldn't allow a friend to talk this way about his partner *once*, let alone for years and years. \n\nIt's probably small wonder he hangs out with such a horrible person. He's at least tacitly approving of what this friend does and says.": [8], "If your bf can\u2019t stand up for you, is that who you want to build a future with?": [7], "100% a bf problem, I would never let a friend or family member disrespect my wife, not when she was my gf, not once, not ever. He is allowing you to be abused, completely signing off on it.": [6], "Boundaries do not have to be fair to be valid, they need only to protect you.\n\nIf your boyfriend knows and does nothing, then you're boundary needs to be to step away, because you will never be happy in a relationship in which you're feeling hurt and disrespected.\n\nIt might take you some time to digest and accept that, and that's ok. But the sooner you do, the happier you will be. There's so much more out there you don't even know how to comprehend it right now - that you can say no to behavior that is unacceptable.": [5], "This would be a deal breaker for me abs it or should be for you.  Typically guys punch other guys that say rude things about their girlfriends much less too them.  Good luck what we you do but have respect for yourself!": [4], "Honestly, I would say give him the ultimatum. It\u2019s him (the friend) or me (the girlfriend). He should have pushed him away years ago.": [3], "Uh yeah. Yes - because your boyfriend is still hanging out with this person and not prioritizing you. I wouldn't waste your precious years on this situation anymore. Your bf isn't standing up for you or himself, which is super unhealthy and childish.": [2], "You could try letting it go like water off a duck\u2019s back or like Teflon.  You know the best friend is a jerk.  You know your bf loves you.  What does it matter what his friend says?  You and your bf know the truth.  And maybe his friend is only saying these things to get a reaction from you.": [-5], "So why does he hate you so much?  Either his friend is a psychopath and hates you for NO reason or there is something you've done to spark it.": [-7]}
